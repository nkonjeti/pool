##Project Proposal
For my project proposal I would like to make an **eight-ball pool game**. 
I love playing eight-ball
and I feel like my knowledge from programming the ideal-gas simulation will help me.
Since in the ideal-gas simulation, my code handled collisions between gas particles
and between the particles and the walls. In eight-ball, I will have to 
program collisions between the balls in the game and the walls. The challenge would 
be including player interaction with the stick and hitting balls at different
angles. I find these challenges interesting.

In week one, I plan on programming the stick hitting the white ball which will hit
and collide with the other balls in the board. My code will handle collisions between
balls and collisions between the balls and walls.

In week two, the stick should be able to hit the white ball at any angle. Also
my code will deal with the balls going in the hole. And all the balls have to start
in the center when the game starts.

In week three, the user can hit the balls with any amount of power. And I will
draw with cinder a white dashed line to show where the stick is pointing at. I will
program a way of winning game (which is all the balls going in the holes). 

Stretch goals for this project (if I finish early) would be having another player 
(like a robot) play against someone playing my game.
