Hit all the balls of the same type into holes, and then hit the eight ball into a hole to win.
The type of ball is determined by the first ball you hit into a hole. If you shoot the cue ball
into the hole, you can place it back anywhere on the board. If you shoot the eight
ball into a hole before scoring all the balls of the same type, you lose. If you
shoot a ball of another type in a hole you lose.
